I am doing this hackathon problem in Azure AI Foundary. The above are resources created so far
The below are the agents and its task so far

1. if he has the problem statement to present in the folder if so provide folder path and automatically mail the relevant sponsors after reading the document for sponsorship to relevant companies else if you need a problem statement
2. He needs a problem statement for the hackathon - if he needs specific domains for topic then ask him or else leave and proceed with sponsor.
3. The company approaches with a problem statement for the hackathon. donot reach out to sponsors in this case

Sponsors Agent
- For generated problem / CSI - search for sponsors by mailing them (details are in .txt file attached)

The entire process should be automated
